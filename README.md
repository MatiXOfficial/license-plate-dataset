## Romanian (European Union) Dataset of License Plates

### Format

A dataset of Romanian (European Union) license plates in VOC format using [VOTT](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT).

### Specs

The dataset is composed of 534 images of which 80% of them are for training and the rest of 20% is for validation. Since the dataset is rather small, it is encouraged to fine-tune a preexisting model with this dataset.

The dataset was shot in both daytime and nightime.
